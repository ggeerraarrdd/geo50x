# Geo50x
It's like _Where's Waldo?_ but for houses

## Description
Geo50x is an online carto-architectural scavenger hunt originally designed and implemented by Gerard Bul-lalayao for the final project assignment of [CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) (HarvardX, 2023).

The gameplay is simple. Given a photo of a house somewhere in the world, you are tasked with locating that house on Google Maps. It's that straighforward. Although the search might not be.

Geo50x is inspired by such childhood games as _[Where's Waldo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F)_ and _[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego)_. And the simple pleasures of looking out through vehicle windows and just gazing at the passing landscapes and cityscapes.

## Learning Objectives

### Requirements
_[Assignment brief](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/project/) for CS50x's Final Project (as of September 2023)_

_"The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this courseâ€™s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language(s). You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Codespace. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course."_

### Personal Goals
Apart from what was to be gained from implementing the requirements, this project was used as a vehicle to further learn and/or practice the following:

* Working with Google Maps API

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Flask==2.2.5
* Flask-Session==0.4.1
* Flask_SocketIO==5.3.6
* geographiclib==2.0
* haversine==2.8.0
* Werkzeug==3.0.1

### Usage

Clone it!
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/geo50x.git
```

Go into the project directory and run the command:
```
$ flask run
```

Open the URL after 'Running on'.

### Notes on Google Maps

For the embedded maps to work, you need to use your own API Key. Before you can create one, you will need to create a Google Cloud project, for which you need a Google Cloud account.
* [Set up a Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com)
* [Set up your Google Cloud project](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup)
* [Using API Keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

In your terminal window, execute:
```
$ export MAP_API_KEY=value
```
where `value` is your API key.

Check to confirm if environmental variable is saved by executing
```
$ echo $MAP_API_KEY
```
### Database

You can recreate the database using the queries in `sql.txt`. Then populate the `locs` table with data in `geo50data.csv`. Use of the `geoids` table is not yet implemented (as of v1.0.0).

### Logging In

You can use the following credentials to log in to access a Search History with existing data.

```
username: carto
password: carto
```

## Version History
* See [https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/geo50x/releases](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/geo50x/releases)

## Future Work
* Add functionalities to Search History page such as ~~reviewing submitted locations~~ _(Update Nov 2, 2023: Done)_ and ~~more easily re-try locations attempted but not yet found~~ _(Update Nov 2, 2023: Done)_.
* Add administration interface for data management.
* Deploy app on AWS Lightsail.

## Acknowledgments
* The distribution code for CS50's Finance problem served as a template for the app.
* The documentions for the Google Maps Platform were a daily, often hourly, read.
* Too many StackOverflow [Q&As](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267822/if-stack-overflow-doesnt-have-threads-what-the-heck-should-they-be-called) and Medium articles to mention but a couple proved immensely useful in developing two key functions
   * [Offset Latitude and Longitude by some meters accurately - Reverse Haversine](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/411859/offset-latitude-and-longitude-by-some-meters-accurately-reverse-haversine)
   * [Algorithm for offsetting a latitude/longitude by some amount of meters](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2951/algorithm-for-offsetting-a-latitude-longitude-by-some-amount-of-meters)
* The folks at CS50 for a mind-altering course.
